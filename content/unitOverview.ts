  title: "Algorithmic Thinking & Applied Mathematics",
  gradeLevel: "High School (9-10)",
  mode: "Fully Virtual / Synchronous & Asynchronous",
  theme: "Bridging the gap between abstract algebra and computational logic through interactive problem solving.",
  description: "This 6-lesson unit introduces students to the fundamental thought processes shared by mathematicians and computer scientists. Starting with decomposition and logic, moving through data visualization, and concluding with algebraic variables in programming contexts, students build a mental model that sees code as applied math and math as a tool for modeling logic.",
  diversityFocus: "Designed with Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. Lessons utilize multi-modal instruction (visual, text, interactive) to support diverse learners. Scaffolding is heavy in early lessons and gradually fades. Cultural responsiveness is addressed by using neutral, real-world examples (e.g., cooking, navigation) that allow students to bring their own context to the problem-solving process."
